# BhumiBandhu: Digital Land Record Management System

BhumiBandhu is a prototype application designed to modernize and secure land ownership records using digital technology, focusing on transparency, history tracking, and dispute resolution.

This project is built using a modern React/TypeScript stack and uses local browser storage for persistence (simulating a database connection).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the BhumiBandhu application locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed:

1. **Node.js & npm** (Node Package Manager) - <https://nodejs.org/>

2. **Git** - <https://git-scm.com/>

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository using the HTTPS link:

git clone https://github.com/Sonu1011/bhumi-digi-enhancements.git


### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder

Change directory into the newly cloned project:

cd bhumi-digi-enhancements


### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Node.js packages and libraries:

npm install


### 4. Run the Application

Start the development server using the defined `dev` script. This command uses **Vite** to compile and serve the application.

npm run dev


The application will now be running on a local port, typically **`http://localhost:5173/`**. Open this URL in your web browser.

## üó∫Ô∏è Site Map & Navigation

The application features a single-page structure managed by **React Router**. All main features are accessible via the top navigation bar.

| Route | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/` | `Home` | Landing page and project overview. |
| `/dashboard` | `Dashboard` | Key metrics, statistics, and overview of all land records. |
| `/add-land` | `AddLand` | Form for digitizing a new land record, owner, and official data. |
| `/history-disputes` | `HistoryDisputes` | Search function to verify land ownership history and track disputes. |
| `/measurement-tool` | `MeasurementTool` | Interface for simulating GPS/device connection and data capture. |
| `/map-view` | `MapView` | Visualization of all geo-tagged land records. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Dependencies

This project is built on a modern, robust front-end stack.
